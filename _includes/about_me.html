            I have over 4 years of experience as a Salesforce and JS developer, and have worked
            at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient full-stack
            developer, my expertise is in building Lightning Components, LWC, Vue.js, APEX development.
        </p>
        <p>
           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a individual contributor role where I can take on on challanges and responsibilites, and gain experience with
           Salesforce and JS development.
